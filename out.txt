This is the same as the one that determines the color of hair. In other words, the reason for greying of skin is the same as the one that causes greying of hair. This is because the gene that produces the amount of melanin that is used to produce the color of hair is the same as the one that produces the color of hair. This is because the gene that produces the color of hair is the same as the one that produces the color of skin. This is because the gene that produces the color of hair is the same as the one that produces the color of skin. This is because the gene that produces the color of hair is the same as the one that produces the color of skin.
